      <p class="aboutparagraph">Growing up in Seoul, South Korea, I developed a passion for art and design at a young age. As someone who grew up in South Korea, my cultural background has played a significant role in shaping my perspective as a designer. In Korea, there is a strong emphasis on beauty and aesthetics in all aspects of life, from architecture to fashion to food. This appreciation for design and beauty has influenced my approach to design, as I prioritize creating visually appealing and aesthetically pleasing designs. I pursued this passion in high school by majoring in Visual Communication Design (VICM) and later moved to the United States in 2018 to continue my education. Moving to the United States in 2018 was a significant transition for me, both personally and professionally. It allowed me to gain exposure to different design styles, techniques, and approaches that I had not encountered before. Being immersed in a new environment also allowed me to step out of my comfort zone and challenge myself to think differently, be more creative, and push the boundaries of my design abilities.
</p>
    <p class="aboutparagraph">My ultimate goal is to become a designer, sharing my creativity with others, working in various industries, and making a positive impact on the world. Engaging with people through my designs allows me to receive feedback and improve my skills, while also connecting with professionals in the field. I enjoy collaborating on projects that celebrate cultural heritage and contribute to communities.

</p>
  <p class="aboutparagraph">Versatility is important to me, and I aim to work in diverse industries and settings to develop a range of skills, increasing my employability and marketability. This adaptability allows me to stay current in my field and choose projects that align with my interests and values, providing a sense of fulfillment and stability in my career.
</p>
  <p class="aboutparagraph">I am passionate about making a positive impact through my designs, such as improving the quality of life for people with disabilities by creating accessible products. I am committed to designing with empathy, promoting inclusivity, and addressing environmental issues through my work. My background in Visual Information and Communication Design and my college studies prepare me to pursue my dream of becoming a designer, creating a legacy that inspires others.
